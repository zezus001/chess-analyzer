# Chess Analyzer

A Python rewrite of an unfinished Roblox Luau chess analyzer project.  
Current focus is implementing basic chess structure and functions.

## Current Status
- Board + starting position implemented
- Piece objects + move logic in progress
- Move generation WIP

## How to Run

python board.py

## Goals
- Generate legal moves
- Detect check/checkmate
- Basic move rewinding
- Some form of move input
- Possibly a GUI later

## Notes
This is a learning/project repo. Goals, structure and code will change a lot.
